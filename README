1. about
--------

    'alock' locks your current session in X. its not a fullfeatured
    screensaver-distribution like 'xlockmore' or 'xscreensaver' but just a
    tiny locker: "uh, i need coffee .. so i need a lock" .. speaking of size: 
    binary takes only 11kb. 'alock' shows the content of the locked screen .. so you can
    see whats going on, even when you are not able to modify what you see.
    this is pretty usefull for public terminals where a demo should run which
    shouldnt interupted (you know those little kids who press every button and
    click everywhere ...).

    an irc-friend of mine (izhirahider) is using 'xtrlock' and had some
    problems with it .. no wonder, development stopped some years ago
    and it doesnt support pam. since i like the minimalism of 'xtrlock' 
    but wanted to add some minor things to it i "forked" 'alock' from
    'xtrlock' and modified it a bit :)

2. installation
---------------

    to install / compile 'alock' you need 'scons':

        http://www.scons.org

    its a clever buildsystem which i prefer over make/autotools.
    after installing 'scons' you just type:

        $> scons

    and it should build your personal version of 'alock'
    you can influence the build-process by some variables, check

        $> scons -h

    to finally install it to your system use:

        $> scons install

    and thats it.

    tested platforms (so far):

        gentoo-linux (pc and ppc with gcc3.4.3) 
        freebsd5.3 (pc gcc3.4.2)
        slackware (pc, gcc3.3.5, shadow)

3. usage
--------

    you find more info about how to use 'alock' in the alock.txt-file. that
    file is used to create all the other documentation-formats provided.
