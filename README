About
-----
'alock' locks your current session in X. It's not a full featured
screensaver distribution like 'xlockmore' or 'xscreensaver', but just a
tiny locker: "uh, i need coffee .. so i need a lock" .. 
You can modify the way you have to authenitificate yourself, the way the
mousepointer looks when you locked the display and the way the content of
the display is handled. Eg: with -bg none you can see whats going on, 
even when you are not able to modify what you see, which might be pretty 
usefull for public terminals where a demo should run but noone should
press any buttons or keys (you know those little kids ... )

Installation
------------
To install / compile 'alock' you need 'scons':

* link:http://www.scons.org[scons]

It's a clever buildsystem which i prefer over make/autotools. Be sure you
grab the latest (0.96.90) version installed to avoid problems at install-time.
After installing 'scons' you just type:

    $> scons

and it should build your personal version of 'alock'.
You can influence the build-process by some variables, check

    $> scons -h

To install it finally to your system use:

    $> scons install

and thats it.
If you grabed a svn-version (not a release-tarball) you also need
'asciidoc' and 'xmlto' to create the documentation-files:

* link:http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc]
* link:http://cyberelk.net/tim/xmlto/[xmlto]

Tested platforms (so far):

* gentoo-linux (pc and ppc with gcc3.4.3) 
* freebsd5.3 (pc gcc3.4.2)
* slackware (pc, gcc3.3.5, shadow)

Usage
-----
You find more info about how to use 'alock' in the alock-documentation:

    $> less alock.txt
    $> man alock
    $> firefox alock.html

History
-------
An irc-buddy of mine (izhirahider) was using 'xtrlock' and had some
problems with it .. no wonder, development stopped some years ago
and it doesnt support 'pam'. Since i liked the minimalism of 'xtrlock' 
but wanted to add some minor things to it i forked 'alock' from
'xtrlock' and modified it a bit :) At the moment there is almost no code
from 'xtrlock' left.
