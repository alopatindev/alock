NAME
----
alock - locks the local X display until the correct password is entered.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'alock' [-h] [-v] [-bg type:opts] [-cursor type:opts] [-auth type:opts]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'alock' locks the X server until the user enters the correct password at the
keyboard. If the authentification was successful, the X server is
unlocked and the user can continue to work.

'alock' does not provide fancy animations like 'xlock' and 'xscreensaver'
and never will. It's just for locking the current X session.

When 'alock' is started it just waits for the first keypress. This first
keypress is to indicate that the user now wants to type in the password.
A colored frame is draw around the screen and the user can now type in
his password. If it was typed in incorrectly, the colored frame turns red and
the user has to wait a certain timeout. Then he can activate the typeing mode
again.
