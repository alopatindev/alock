NAME
----
alock - locks the local X display until a password is entered.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'alock' [-h] [-v] [-bg type:opts] [-cursor type:opts] [-auth type:opts]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
alock locks the X server till the user enters a password at the
keyboard. If the authentification was successful the X server is
unlocked and the user can continue to work.

alock does not provide fancy animations like 'xlock' and 'xscreensaver'
and never will. Its just for locking the current X session.
